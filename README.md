## DESCRIPTION

This is my first application using TypeScript. I also used KendoUI but because I do not have a license, this project is not deployed. My reason for using TypeScript and KendoUI is because I recently interviewed with a company who use these technologies in their stack. I defintely see the advantages in using TypeScript, especially with creating data and passing data to functions. The syntax can be a bit tricky (and, at times annoying) but it is extremely useful and I will begin implementing it in more of my projects. I only included a few components from KendoUI because I wasn't sure of the limits of my free trial. It is an interesting library and would like to explore it more if I had full access.

This project allows an Admin to add items to the menu. A user can click on any item in the menu to order it. An alert message will show up with some information about the order. The "Now Preparing Order" view will update with the current order number and the "In-Line Register View" will have it's total (set to $100) update with the cost of that pizza. 🍕

## DESIGN AND ASSETS

Design is minimal. I make use of KendoUI Form and Card components.

## GOALS

My goal for this project was to simply get a feel for TypeScript and the KendoUI Library.

## WISHLIST

I would be happy to have full access to the KendoUI Library to further develop this application and its interface.

## INSTALLATION

- Node.js version >= v18.17.0 is required
